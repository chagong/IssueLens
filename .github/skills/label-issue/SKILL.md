# Label Issue Skill

Automatically classify and label GitHub issues based on repository-specific labeling instructions.

## Overview

This skill analyzes GitHub issue content (title, body, comments) and applies appropriate labels based on labeling rules defined in the target repository's `.github/label-instructions.md` file.

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Receive issue URL or issue number with repository (owner/repo)
2. **Fetch labeling instructions**: Read `.github/label-instructions.md` from the repository
3. **Fetch issue**: Get issue details (title, body, existing labels)
4. **Analyze issue**: Match issue content against labeling rules
5. **Determine labels**: Select appropriate labels based on:
   - Keyword matching
   - Issue type detection (bug, feature, question, etc.)
   - Priority assessment
   - Area/component identification
6. **Apply labels**: Use Python script to add labels via GitHub API
7. **Report**: Confirm labels applied with reasoning

## Reading Labeling Instructions

Fetch `.github/label-instructions.md` from the target repository using GitHub MCP tools. The file should define:

- **Available labels**: List of valid labels with descriptions
- **Labeling rules**: Criteria for when to apply each label
- **Keywords mapping**: Keywords that trigger specific labels

For template format, see [references/label_instructions_template.md](references/label_instructions_template.md).

If `.github/label-instructions.md` is not found:
1. Fetch the list of labels defined in the target repository using `github/list_labels`
2. Create a brief summary of available labels based on their names and descriptions
3. Use the summary to determine which labels best match the issue content

## Issue Analysis

Analyze issue content to determine appropriate labels by:

1. **Type Detection**: Match issue keywords against label names/descriptions
2. **Priority Assessment**: Identify severity indicators in the issue
3. **Area Detection**: Match issue content against area-specific labels

## Applying Labels

Run the bundled Python script to add labels:

```bash
# Install dependency
pip install requests

# Add labels to an issue
python scripts/label_issue.py <owner> <repo> <issue_number> <labels>

# Example: add bug and priority:high labels
python scripts/label_issue.py microsoft vscode 123 "bug,priority:high"

# Example: add multiple area labels
python scripts/label_issue.py microsoft vscode 123 "bug,area:ui,area:api"
```

The script [scripts/label_issue.py](scripts/label_issue.py) handles the GitHub API call.

## Example Commands

- "Label issue #123 in microsoft/vscode"
- "What labels should this issue have? https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/456"
- "Classify and label issue #789"
- "Add appropriate labels to this bug report"

## Output

Report the labeling decision with:

- **Labels applied**: List of labels added
- **Reasoning**: Why each label was chosen
  - Type: "Detected as bug (keywords: 'not working', 'error')"
  - Priority: "High priority (affects core functionality)"
  - Area: "Matched 'ui' area (keywords: button, dialog)"
- **Existing labels**: Labels already on the issue (not modified)

## Example Output

```
✅ Labels added to issue #123: bug, priority:high, area:ui

**Reasoning:**
- **bug**: Issue describes broken functionality ("button not working")
- **priority:high**: Core feature affected, no workaround mentioned
- **area:ui**: UI-related keywords detected (button, click, display)

**Existing labels:** needs-triage (unchanged)
```

## Configuration

The skill requires:

1. **GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN** or **GITHUB_PAT** environment variable with `repo` scope
2. **label-instructions.md** in target repository (optional but recommended)

## Fallback Behavior

If labeling instructions are not found:
1. Use default type detection rules
2. Skip priority and area labels
3. Report that default rules were used
