# IssueLens

IssueLens is a custom agent that utilizes GitHub Copilot to triage GitHub issues. It runs daily to identify and summarize critical issues across **multiple GitHub repositories**, helping maintainers stay on top of hot, blocking, and regression issues. While currently configured for Java Tooling, it can be easily adopted by any other repositories with minimal modification.

## How It Works

1.  **Scheduled Analysis**: A GitHub Workflow (`.github/workflows/issueLens-run.yml`) runs daily at 00:00 UTC.
2.  **Agent Execution**: The workflow invokes the **IssueLens Agent** using the GitHub Copilot CLI.
3.  **Issue Triage**: The agent scans for issues opened "today" in the specified target repositories and filters them based on "Critical Issue Criteria".
4.  **Notification**: The analysis result (in JSON format) is sent to a configured webhook URL using a custom notification action.

## Components

### 1. IssueLens Agent (`.github/agents/issuelens.agent.md`)

The core of the project is a custom agent definition. By default, it is configured to act as an experienced developer for the target domain.

**Target Repositories (Example Configuration):**
*   `microsoft/vscode-java-pack`
*   `redhat-developer/vscode-java`
*   `eclipse-jdtls/eclipse.jdt.ls`
*   `microsoft/vscode-java-debug`
*   `microsoft/java-debug`
*   `microsoft/vscode-java-test`
*   `microsoft/vscode-gradle`
*   `microsoft/build-server-for-gradle`
*   `microsoft/vscode-java-dependency`
*   `microsoft/vscode-maven`

**Critical Issue Criteria:**
*   **Hot Issues**: Multiple reports of the same symptom, or significant user engagement (reactions/comments).
*   **Blocking Issues**: Core functionality broken with no workaround.
*   **Regression Issues**: Features broken in the current release that worked previously.

### 2. Notification Action (`.github/actions/notification/action.yml`)

A composite GitHub Action that handles sending the JSON payload generated by the agent to an external endpoint (e.g., a Logic App or Slack webhook) via HTTP POST.

### 3. Workflow (`.github/workflows/issueLens-run.yml`)

Orchestrates the process:
*   Sets up the environment (Node.js, Copilot CLI).
*   Runs the agent with a specific prompt.
*   Parses the JSON output.
*   Triggers the notification.

## Setup & Configuration

To run this workflow in your own repository, you need to configure the following **GitHub Secrets**:

*   `PAT`: A Personal Access Token with permissions to access the repositories and use Copilot.
*   `NOTIFICATION_URL`: The endpoint URL where the JSON summary should be sent.
